SOLVE SAT WITH RSAT

1. UNSATISFIABLE
2. SATISFIABLE
3. This gives us an indication that graph 1 has a minimum number of colors required to properly color this graph.
That number is 4, because k=3 results in unsatisfiable and k=4 is statisfiable, which provides us with a solution to the graph coloring problem.
A specified color assignment would be:
Node 1 has color 1
Node 2 has color 2
Node 3 has color 3
Node 4 has color 1
Node 5 has color 2
Node 6 has color 3
Node 7 has color 4
4. the minimum number of colors required to properly color this graph is k = 4.
